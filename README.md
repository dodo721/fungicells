# Fungi Cells Javascript Simulation

The aim of this project is to simulate plant mould/fungi cells growing and searching for food in a 2d environment.
It is managed as a procedural cell simulation made of a 2d array, with each "cell" having a type, value, and applied rules.
The javascript simulation runs in-browser with jQuery, served with a Node.JS Express server.
